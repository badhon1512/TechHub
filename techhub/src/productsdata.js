Thanks to stunning image quality and speed based on technology developed for our full-frame models, you can leave the hard work to the camera. The α6100 ensures you'll never miss an instant. Keeping active subjects in constant, steady focus is absolutely vital to capturing every important moment, whether you're covering a sporting event or documenting everyday life. Sony's sophisticated AI-based subject-tracking algorithms won't let you down, processing massive volumes of spatial data at high speed and in real time. Real-time Eye AF provides continuous eye tracking when shooting portraits in motion. You can prioritize either the left or the right eye, and it works even when the face is partially hidden, backlit or facing downwards. Sony's innovative eye-detection algorithms have been adapted to animal as well as human, to give you sharply focused pet portraits and beautiful wildlife shots. The camera's wide AF coverage is based on dense arrays of 425 phase-detection points and 425 contrast-detection points, for greatly increased detection accuracy. Fast performance from the latest-generation processing engine helps achieve a remarkable 0.02-second AF acquisition speed, while advanced algorithms work to predict your subject's future location. Impressively speedy internal processing and the high-capacity buffer memory mean you can fire off continuous shots at up to 11fps with after-view or 8fps for real-time preview, with minimal display lag. You can take around 77 shots in JPEG (Standard) format in one continuous burst. Silent shooting is helpful in situations where noise would be distracting, such as at live performances or when taking animal portraits. The α6100 can shoot continuously without shutter noise at up to 8fps with AF/AE tracking, even in AF-C mode, and with Real-time Eye AF or with Real-time Tracking.",

        AMD is preparing two variants for the sub-$150 US market, the Ryzen 5 3500X & the Ryzen 5 3500. Both processors feature 6 cores and 6 threads which means that there won't be multi-threading support on either chip, however, given their price point and the market they are aiming, a cut-down core configuration is expected. As such, these would be the first Ryzen 3000 parts with no multi-threading support. Starting off with the AMD Ryzen 5 3500X, we are looking at a base clock of 3.6 GHz and a boost clock of 4.1 GHz. The processor features 32 MB of cache, a 65W TDP and a price close to $150 US. It is highly liked that AMD would choose a $149.99 US price for this specific chip. In official slides posted by BullsLab, the chip comes with 24 PCIe Gen 4 lanes, support for 3200 MHz memory and we also get to take a look at some performance benchmarks where the chip is highly competitive.The Ryzen 5 3500, on the other hand, has pretty much the same specifications and even the same clock speeds of 3.6 GHz base and 4.1 GHz boost. The difference is that it features 16 MB of cache versus 32 MB on the Ryzen 5 3600X. It would result in a small performance penalty but we are also looking at a lower price point. This processor also has 03 years warranty.`,
